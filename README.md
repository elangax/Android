Getting Started
---------------

To get started with OMNI sources to build TWRP, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the OMNIROM trees to build TWRP, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/lj50036/platform_manifest_twrp_omni.git -b twrp-5.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Then to build:

     cd <source-dir>; . build/envsetup.sh; brunch <device_name>
